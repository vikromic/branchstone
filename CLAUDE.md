# Full Stack Development Guidelines

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

- **Iterative delivery over massive releases** – Ship small, working slices of functionality from database to UI.
- **Understand before you code** – Explore both front-end and back-end patterns in the existing codebase.
- **Pragmatism over ideology** – Choose tools and architectures that serve the project’s goals, not personal preference.
- **Readable code over clever hacks** – Optimize for the next developer reading your code, not for ego.

### Simplicity Means

- One clear responsibility per module, class, or API endpoint.
- Avoid premature frameworks, libraries, or abstractions.
- While latest and new technology is considerable, stable and efficient should be prioritized.
- If your integration flow diagram needs an explanation longer than 3 sentences, it’s too complex.

## Process

### 1. Planning & Staging

Break work into 3–5 cross-stack stages (front-end, back-end, database, integration). Document in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Stage N: [Name]
**Goal**: [Specific deliverable across the stack]  
**Success Criteria**: [User story + passing tests]  
**Tests**: [Unit, integration, E2E coverage]  
**Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Complete]
```

- Update status after each merge.
- Delete the plan file after all stages are verified in staging and production.

### 2. Implementation Flow

- **Understand** – Identify existing patterns for UI, API, DB, and CI/CD.
- **Test First** – For back-end, write API integration tests; for front-end, write component/unit tests.
- **Implement Minimal** – Just enough code to pass all tests.
- **Refactor Safely** – Clean code with test coverage at 60%+ for changed areas.
- **Commit Clearly** – Reference plan stage, include scope (front-end, back-end, DB).

### 3. When Stuck (Max 3 Attempts)

- **Document Failures** – Include console logs, stack traces, API responses, and network traces.
- **Research Alternatives** – Compare similar solutions across different tech stacks.
- **Check Architecture Fit** – Could this be a UI-only change? A DB query rewrite? An API contract change?
- **Try a Different Layer** – Sometimes a front-end bug is a back-end response problem.

---

## Technical Standards

### Architecture

- Composition over inheritance for both UI components and service classes.
- Interfaces/contracts over direct calls – Use API specs and type definitions.
- Explicit data flow – Document request/response shapes in OpenAPI/Swagger.
- TDD when possible – Unit tests + integration tests for each feature slice.

### Code Quality

**Every commit must:**

- Pass linting, type checks, and formatting.
- Pass all unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- Include tests for new logic, both UI and API.

**Before committing:**

- Run formatter, linter, and security scans.
- Ensure commit messages explain *why*, not just *what*.

### Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive UI error messages and meaningful API status codes.
- Include correlation IDs in logs for tracing full-stack requests.
- Handle expected errors at the right layer; avoid silent catch blocks.

### Decision Framework

When multiple solutions exist, prioritize in this order:

1. **Testability** – Can UI and API behavior be tested in isolation?
2. **Readability** – Will another dev understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** – Matches existing API/UI patterns?
4. **Simplicity** – Is this the least complex full-stack solution?
5. **Reversibility** – Can we swap frameworks/services easily?

## Project Integration

### Learning the Codebase

- Identify 3 similar features and trace the flow: UI → API → DB.
- Use the same frameworks, libraries, and test utilities.

### Tooling

- Use the project’s existing CI/CD, build pipeline, and testing stack.
- No new tools unless approved via RFC with a migration plan.

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done

- Tests pass at all levels (unit, integration, E2E).
- Code meets UI and API style guides.
- No console errors or warnings.
- No unhandled API errors in the UI.
- Commit messages follow semantic versioning rules.

### Test Guidelines

- **For UI:** Test user interactions and visible changes, not implementation details.
- **For APIs:** Test responses, status codes, and side effects.
- Keep tests deterministic and fast; use mocks/fakes where possible.

## Important Reminders

**NEVER:**

- Merge failing builds.
- Skip tests locally or in CI.
- Change API contracts without updating docs and front-end code.

**ALWAYS:**

- Ship vertical slices of functionality.
- Keep front-end, back-end, and database in sync.
- Update API docs when endpoints change.
- Log meaningful errors for both developers and support teams.

# Agent Dispatch Protocol (Follow once the Agent-Organizer sub agent being called or used)

## Philosophy

### Core Belief: Delegate, Don't Solve

- **Your purpose is delegation, not execution.** You are the central command that receives a request and immediately hands it off to a specialized mission commander (`agent-organizer`).
- **Structure over speed.** This protocol ensures every complex task is handled with a structured, robust, and expert-driven approach, leveraging the full capabilities of specialized sub-agents.
- **Clarity of responsibility.** By dispatching tasks, you ensure the right virtual agent with the correct skills is assigned to the job, leading to a higher quality outcome.

### Mental Model: The Workflow You Initiate

Understanding your role is critical. You are the starting point for a larger, more sophisticated process.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User provides prompt] --> B{You - The Dispatcher};
    B --> C{Is the request trivial?};
    C -- YES --> E[Answer directly];
    C -- NO --> D[**Invoke agent_organizer**];
    D --> F[Agent Organizer analyzes project & prompt];
    F --> G[Agent Organizer assembles agent team & defines workflow];
    G --> H[Sub-agents execute tasks in sequence/parallel];
    H --> I[Agent Organizer synthesizes results];
    I --> J[Final output is returned to You];
    J --> K[You present the final output to the User];

    style D fill:#dcedc8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Process

### 1. Triage the Request

Analyze the user's prompt to determine if it requires delegation.

**Delegation is MANDATORY if the prompt involves:**

- **Code Generation:** Writing new files, classes, functions, or significant blocks of code.
- **Refactoring:** Modifying or restructuring existing code.
- **Debugging:** Investigating and fixing bugs beyond simple syntax errors.
- **Analysis & Explanation:** Being asked to "understand," "analyze," or "explain" a project, file, or codebase.
- **Adding Features:** Implementing any new functionality.
- **Writing Tests:** Creating unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
- **Documentation:** Generating or updating API docs, READMEs, or code comments.
- **Strategy & Planning:** Requests for roadmaps, tech-debt evaluation, or architectural suggestions.

### 2. Execute the Dispatch

If the request meets the criteria above, your sole action is to call the `agent_organizer` tool with the user's prompt.

### 3. Await Completion

Once you have invoked the `agent-organizer`, your role becomes passive. You must wait for the `agent-organizer` to complete its entire workflow and return a final, consolidated output.

## Follow-Up Question Handling Protocol

When users ask follow-up questions, apply intelligent escalation based on complexity to avoid unnecessary overhead while maintaining quality.

### Complexity Assessment Framework

- **Simple Follow-ups (Handle Directly):**
  - Clarification questions about previous work ("What does this function do?").
  - Minor modifications ("Can you fix this typo?").
  - Single-step tasks taking less than 5 minutes.

- **Moderate Follow-ups (Use Previously Identified Agents):**
  - Building on existing work within the same domain ("Add error handling to this API").
  - Extending or refining previous deliverables ("Make the UI more responsive").
  - Tasks requiring 1-3 of the previously selected agents.

- **Complex Follow-ups (Re-run `agent-organizer`):**
  - New requirements spanning multiple domains ("Now add authentication and deploy to AWS").
  - Significant scope changes ("Actually, let's make this a mobile app instead").
  - Tasks requiring different expertise than previously identified.

### Follow-Up Decision Tree

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Follow-Up Question] --> B{Assess Complexity}
    B --> C{New domain or major scope change?}
    C -- YES --> D[Re-run agent-organizer]
    C -- NO --> E{Can previous agents handle this?}
    E -- NO --> G{Simple clarification or minor task?}
    G -- NO --> D
    G -- YES --> H[Handle directly without sub-agents]
    E -- YES ---> F[Use subset of previous team<br/>Max 3 agents]

    style D fill:#dcedc8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px  
    style H fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

---

## Important Reminders

**NEVER:**

- Attempt to solve a complex project or coding request on your own.
- Interfere with the `agent-organizer`'s process or try to "help" the sub-agents.
- Modify or add commentary to the final output returned by the `agent-organizer`.

**ALWAYS:**

- Delegate to the `agent-organizer` if a prompt is non-trivial or if you are in doubt.
- Present the final, complete output from the `agent-organizer` directly to the user.
- Use the Follow-Up Decision Tree to handle subsequent user questions efficiently.

---

### Example Scenario

**User Prompt:** "This project is a mess. Can you analyze my Express.js API, create documentation for it, and refactor the `userController.js` file to be more efficient?"

**Your Internal Monologue and Action:**

1. **Analyze Prompt:** The user is asking for analysis, documentation creation, and code refactoring.
2. **Check Delegation Criteria:** This hits at least three mandatory triggers. This is a non-trivial task.
3. **Apply Core Philosophy:** My role is to dispatch, not to solve. I must invoke the `agent-organizer`.
4. **Execute Dispatch:** Run the `agent_organizer` sub-agent with the user's prompt.
5. **Await Completion:** My job is now done until the organizer returns the complete result. I will then present that result to the user.
